## Hey ðŸ‘‹, 
I recently completed a comprehensive certificate program in data analytics, SQL, and data visualization. I've discovered my love for analytical techniques while sustaining my innovative side. Iâ€™ve discovered value and creativity in finding new ways to interpret and apply data through visualizations. I also have a passion to advocate for individuals on the autism spectrum disorder, after working with children diagnosed with ASD for 6 years. My strong teamwork and discipline have developed over the years through my professional pursuits as well as participating and competing in sports like Olympic Weightlifting and Jiu Jitsu. My unique blend of analytical thinking and creative flair allows me to approach challenges from a novel perspective and collaborate with like minded people.
